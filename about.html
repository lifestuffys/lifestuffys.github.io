        <h2>Hayo LIFE! :P</h2>
        <h4>Origins</h4>
        <p>Started on February 16, 2023, LIFE Stuffys is a freelance graphic design business. Any illustration—whether hand-drawn or digital—or logo you need, we sketch your ideas to life!</p>

        <h4>Ian Flores Escalante // The Artist</h4>
        <p>Hecho en México, Raised a Texan: My name is Ian Flores Escalante—the Flower Boyo and the I F E of LIFE</p>
        <p>Since my childhood, I have been sketching whatever I found intriguing, initially as a fun childish hobby. However, as I've grown older, I found an aesthetic joy in the skill of art which made me want to do it at a professional level. Thus LIFE Stuffys was born</p>
        <p>For me, nothing is better than a perfectly made image</p>
        <p>My only formal education that I have received was in my middle school years (haha I know, not very spectacular). Aside from that, most of my artistic refinement has come from many, many personal attempts</p>

        <h4>Mr. Bubbleman // The Face of LIFE Stuffys</h4>
        <p>Hewwos, I'm Mr. Bubbleman!!</p>
        <p>I have no expertise in anything but, because I am fictional, I can do whatever I want!! Therefore, I act as the bootiful face of LIFE Stuffys</p>
        <p>Now, how old am I?? No idea. Where did I come from?? No idea either—and neither does Ian!! All we remember is that in Ian's sophomore year of high school (2018-2019) I became a lil doodle drawn around the edges of paper notes during classes. And since I looked bubble-like, my name was created: Mr. Bubbleman. Sadly I was thrown away at the end of the year, so my initial adventures are gone… yet I have thrived!! I pop up whenever and wherever I can hehe</p>
        <p>My more prominent role came when LIFE Stuffys was in development (July 2022) to become a thing. While drafting the idea of a freelance graphic design business, Ian gave me the role to become the bootiful face of LIFE Stuffys. And so, I took it and made it my goal to make yall laugh!!</p>
        <p>No, I am not a real person—I am literally a random figment of imagination from Ian's mind</p>
