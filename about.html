                <p class="heading">Ian Flores Escalante</p>

                <p>Hecho en México, Raised a Texan: My name is Ian Flores Escalante—the Flower Boyo and the I F E of LIFE.<br><br>Since my childhood, I have been sketching whatever I found intriguing, initially as a fun childish hobby. However, as I've grown older, I found an aesthetic joy in the skill of art which made me want to do it at a professional level. Thus LIFE Stuffys was born.<br><br>For me, nothing is better than a perfectly made image.<br><br>My only formal education that I have received was in my middle school years (haha I know, not very spectacular). Aside from that, most of my artistic refinement has come from many, many personal attempts.</p>

                <p class="heading">Mr. Bubbleman</p>
                <p>Hewwos, I'm Mr. Bubbleman!!</p>
                <p>I have no expertise in anything but, because I am fictional, I can do whatever I want!! Therefore, I act as the bootiful face of LIFE Stuffys.</p>
                <p>Now, how old am I?? No idea. Where did I come from?? No idea either—and neither does Ian!! All we remember is that in Ian's sophomore year of high school (2018-2019) I became a lil doodle drawn around the edges of paper notes during classes. And since I looked bubble-like, my name was created: Mr. Bubbleman. Sadly I was thrown away at the end of the year, so my initial adventures are gone… yet I have thrived!! I pop up whenever and wherever I can hehe.</p>
                <p>My more prominent role came when LIFE Stuffys was in development (July 2022) to become a thing. While drafting the idea of a freelance graphic design business, Ian gave me the role to become the bootiful face of LIFE Stuffys. And so, I took it and made it my goal to make yall laugh!!</p>
                <p>No, I am not a real person—I am literally a random figment of imagination from Ian's mind.</p>
